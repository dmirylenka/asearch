{:title "Learning relational affordance models for robots in multi-object manipulation tasks"
:abstract "Affordances define the action possibilities on an object in the environment and in robotics they play a role in basic cognitive capabilities. Previous works have focused on affordance models for just one object even though in many scenarios they are defined by configurations of multiple objects that interact with each other. We employ recent advances in statistical relational learning to"}
{:title "Probabilistic Logic Programming with Well-Founded Negation"
 :abstract "Knowledge representation and inference in AI have been traditionally divided between logic-based and statistical approaches. During the past decade, the rapidly developing area of Statistical Relational Learning aims to combine the two frameworks for representation and inference. In many cases, these works include probabilistic reasoning within Logic Programming frameworks. These attempts are restricted in the sense that they use"}
{:title "Learning probabilistic Description logic concepts: under different Assumptions on missing knowledge"
:abstract "Knowledge available through Semantic Web standards can be missing, generally because of the adoption of the Open World Assumption. We present a Statistical Relational Learning system for learning terminological naïve Bayesian classifiers, which estimate the probability that an individual belongs to a target concept given its membership to a set of Description Logic concepts. During the learning process, we consistently"}
{:title "Higher Order Naïve Bayes: A Novel Non-IID Approach to Text Classification"
:abstract "The underlying assumption in traditional machine learning algorithms is that instances are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). These critical independence assumptions made in traditional machine learning algorithms prevent them from going beyond instance boundaries to exploit latent relations between features. In this paper, we develop a general approach to supervised learning by leveraging higher order dependencies between features. We introduce"}
{:title "Stochastic relational processes: Efficient inference and applications"
 :abstract "One of the goals of artificial intelligence is to develop agents that learn and act in complex environments. Realistic environments typically feature a variable number of objects, relations amongst them, and non-deterministic transition behavior. While standard probabilistic sequence models provide efficient inference and learning techniques for sequential data, they typically cannot fully capture the relational complexity. On the other"}
{:title "Statistical relational learning of trust"
 :abstract "The learning of trust and distrust is a crucial aspect of social interaction among autonomous, mentally-opaque agents. In this work, we address the learning of trust based on past observations and context information. We argue that from the truster’s point of view trust is best expressed as one of several relations that exist between the agent to be trusted"}
{:title "Learning Markov Logic Networks via Functional Gradient Boosting"
 :abstract "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with probabilities. One prominent example is Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). While MLNs are indeed highly expressive, this expressiveness comes at a cost. Learning MLNs is a hard problem and therefore has attracted much interest in the SRL community. Current methods for learning MLNs"}]
