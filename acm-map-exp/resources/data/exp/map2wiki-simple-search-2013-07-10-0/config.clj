 "Map preferred and alternative labels of ACM concepts to Wikipedia using the simple search mechanism of Wikipedia Miner, that tries to resolve the whole string as a Wikipedia article label (title, redirect or anchor text). Run Wikipedia Miner with default parameters. Compute the number of successful (at least one article) and unsuccessful mappings. Display the titles of 100 random successfully mapped concepts with the most likely article and the concept label that mapped to it. Display the titles of 100 random unsucessfully mapped concepts.",
