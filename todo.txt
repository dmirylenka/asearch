    + implement ui with simple algorithm
    implement structured prediction algorithm

thinking:
I need a program where I could change the algorithm of producing submap.

module : topic-map, n-topics -> submap
our dagger-based algo: topic-map -> sequence of topics/submaps
so, more generally,
    module: topic-map, submaps of sizes 1 to T-1 -> submap of size T
