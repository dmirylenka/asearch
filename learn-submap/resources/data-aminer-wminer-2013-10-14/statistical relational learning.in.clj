The World Wide Web provides a nearly endless source of knowledge, which is mostly given in natural language. A first step towards exploiting this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic relation from text documents - for example all pairs of a person and her birthdate. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to apply them to a corpus to find new pairs.

In this paper, a statistical model called statistical local spatial relations (SLSR) is presented as a novel technique of a learning model with spatial and statistical information for semantic image classification. The model is inspired by probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) for text mining. In text analysis, PLSA is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-word document representation. In SLSR, we treat image categories as topics, therefore an image containing instances of multiple categories can be modeled as a mixture of topics. More significantly, SLSR introduces spatial relation information as a factor which is not present in PLSA. SLSR has rotation, scale, translation and affine invariant properties and can solve partial occlusion problems. Using the Dirichlet process and variational Expectation-Maximization learning algorithm, SLSR is developed as an implementation of an image classification algorithm. SLSR uses an unsupervised process which can capture both spatial relations and statistical information simultaneously. The experiments are demonstrated on some standard data sets and show that the SLSR model is a promising model for semantic image classification problems.", :doc-id "Semantic image classification using statistical local spatial relations model. 2008  ,  ,  "}, 3623508 #search_api.search_api.Paper{:id 3623508, :key "journals/ijsnm/EspositoFBM12", :title "Social networks and statistical relational learning: a survey.", :abstract nil, :author (#search_api.search_api.Author{:id 769268, :first-name nil, :last-name nil, :full-name "Floriana Esposito"} #search_api.search_api.Author{:id 1126564, :first-name nil, :last-name nil, :full-name "Stefano Ferilli"} #search_api.search_api.Author{:id 1078358, :first-name nil, :last-name nil, :full-name "Teresa Maria Altomare Basile"} #search_api.search_api.Author{:id 1294122, :first-name nil, :last-name nil, :full-name "Nicola Di Mauro"}), :year 2012, :venue "IJSNM", :ncit 0, :string "Social networks and statistical relational learning: a survey..

Besides rendering the cost estimation problem tractable for XML queries, COMET has the further advantage of enabling the query optimizer to be self-tuning, automatically adapting to changes over time in the query workload and in the system environment. We demonstrate COMET's feasibility by developing a cost model for the recently proposed XNAV navigational operator. Empirical studies with synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data sets show that COMET can quickly obtain accurate cost estimates for a variety of XML queries and data sets.", :doc-id "Statistical Learning Techniques for Costing XML Queries. 2005  ,  ,  ,  ,  "}, 1009754 #search_api.search_api.Paper{:id 1009754, :key "journals/ml/PerlichP06", :title "Distribution-based aggregation for relational learning with identifier attributes.", :abstract "Identifier attributes--very high-dimensional categorical attributes such as particular product ids or people's names--rarely are incorporated in statistical modeling.
