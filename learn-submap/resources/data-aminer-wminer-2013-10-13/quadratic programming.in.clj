Developing scalable algorithms for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is an important challenge. One approach that effectively addresses the intractable memory requirements of POMDP algorithms is based on representing POMDP policies as finite-state controllers. In this paper, we illustrate some fundamental disadvantages of existing techniques that use controllers. We then propose a new approach that formulates the problem as a quadratically constrained linear program (QCLP), which defines an optimal controller of a desired size. This representation allows a wide range of powerful nonlinear programming algorithms to be used to solve POMDPs. Although QCLP optimization techniques guarantee only local optimality, the results we obtain using an existing optimization method show significant solution improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques. The results open up promising research directions for solving large POMDPs using nonlinear programming methods.", :doc-id "Solving POMDPs Using Quadratically Constrained Linear Programs. 2007  ,  ,  "}, 918068 #search_api.search_api.Paper{:id 918068, :key "journals/ijon/ZdunekC08", :title "Nonnegative matrix factorization with quadratic programming.", :abstract "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) solves the following problem: find such nonnegative matrices A@?R\"+^I^x^J and X@?R\"+^J^x^K that Y@?AX, given only Y@?R^I^x^K and the assigned index J (K@?I>=J).

Our main idea is to use the recent Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers. But, for this, we have to first convexify the objective function q(x). A classical trick is to raise up the diagonal entries of Q by a vector u until (Q+diag(u)) is positive semidefinite. Then, using the fact that xi2=xi, we can obtain an equivalent convex objective function, which can then be handled by an MIQP solver. Hence, computing a suitable vector u constitutes a preprocessing phase in this exact solution method. We devise two different preprocessing methods. The first one is straightforward and consists in computing the smallest eigenvalue of Q.

In this paper, we consider problem (P) of minimizing a quadratic function q(x)=x tQx+ctx of binary variables. Our main idea is to use the recent Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers. But, for this, we have to first convexify the objective function q(x). A classical trick is to raise up the diagonal entries of Q by a vector u until (Q+diag(u)) is positive semidefinite. Then, using the fact that xi2=xi, we can obtain an equivalent convex objective function, which can then be handled by an MIQP solver.
